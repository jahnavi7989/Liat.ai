# üèüÔ∏è Player Re-Identification in Sports Video using YOLOv11 + Deep SORT

This project solves a real-world **sports analytics** problem: **player re-identification**. The goal is to assign consistent player IDs to each player throughout a video ‚Äî even when they leave and re-enter the frame.

We use a **custom-trained YOLOv11** model for detecting players and a **Deep SORT tracker** to re-identify players using visual and motion-based features.

## üéØ Objective

> Identify and track players in a 15-second sports video.  
> Ensure that players who go out of the frame and come back retain their original ID.
